/*

EXAM TIP An abstract class may or may not define an abstract method;
you can define an abstract class without any abstract methods. But a concrete
class can’t define an abstract method.


EXAM TIP Don’t be tricked by code that tries to apply the nonaccess modifier
abstract to a variable. Such code won’t compile.
